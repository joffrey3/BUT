Git is a term of insult denoting an unpleasant, silly, incompetent, annoying, senile, elderly or childish person.         
   As a mild oath it is roughly on a par with prat and marginally less pejorative than berk. Typically a 
   good-natured admonition with a strong implication of familiarity, git is more severe than twit or idiot 
   but less severe than wanker, arsehole or twat when offence is intended.
